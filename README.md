# Particle Management System in OpenGL

## Created as part of a group project designing a game engine in C++.

### Two different particle emitters for different trajectories.



### Program manages all the animated particles in the scene to create effects for explosions and object collisions.

#### -The cone emitter generates random vectors for the particles to follow. The range can be limited depending on desired effect.
#### -The sphere emitter will generate the random vectors through 360Â°.
